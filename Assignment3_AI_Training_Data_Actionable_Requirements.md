##  User Requirement: Categorized Training Questions

**User Story:**  
*As an AI developer, I want training questions to be grouped by category so I can quickly find relevant data for model training.*

**Assumption:**  
Categorized questions help developers find relevant data faster.

**Validation Strategy:**  
- Interview developers to evaluate improvements in workflow.  
- Compare search times using categorized vs. uncategorized datasets.  

**Implementation Strategy:**  
- Extend the database schema to include a `category` field.  
- Design a user interface for selecting categories when adding questions.  
- Enable filtering of questions by category in the UI.
